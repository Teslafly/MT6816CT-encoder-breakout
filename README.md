# MT6816CT-encoder-breakout
MT6816CT encoder breakout for vesc

Operates in 3 wire mode, may need to program encoder to get it to work.

Currently vesc only supports 4 wire for MT6816CT.

Todo:
* Add 3 wire transfer support to vesc
* Find out if sensotr needs programming to work in 3 wire mode
	* I can probably blindly write to sensor on startup to put into 3 wire mode. Since MOSI pin connected.
* Add bom with part links
* add pictures
	* KiCad renders
	* top/bottom of board
	* 4 connector configurtations
	* mounted to motor
* add 3d printed mount/standoff stl/cad
* add connecting cable bom / pics
	* 6 pair wire source, jst gh/ph crimps/housings, 
	* temp sensors & 2 pin crimp/housings

Made with KiCad nightly:
